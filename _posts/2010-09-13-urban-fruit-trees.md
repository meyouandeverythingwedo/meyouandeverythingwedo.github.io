    Am still with Not Far From The Tree, even though it&#8217;s tougher to find time to help out whilst working. At least I&#8217;ve been on two pear picks this season and looking forward to getting on the list for picking apples.

    For those not aware, NFFTT is a charity working with volunteers to pick fruit trees in Toronto backyards. We volunteers harvest the fruit and it&#8217;s then divided into thirds &#8211; given to a local foodbank/community food service, the home owner and the volunteers. It&#8217;s a great way to participate in bringing food security to city dwellers, stock up on local fruit for ourselves and meet other people.
