    Lunched with Nicol and Andrew today at Market 190 in McLaren Vale. Discussed the recent floods and cyclone in Queensland, reminisced about our first encounters using a computer and pondered the similarities between Yoda and His Holiness the Dalai Lama. All in all a very interesting afternoon of conversation!
