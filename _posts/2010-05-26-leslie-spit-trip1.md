    We biked down to the Leslie Street Spit last Sunday. About 20 minutes cycling south of home this man made spit is quite remarkable. If I have my facts straight, what we were standing on was a 5km long pile of construction rubble (as well as other hard wastes) dumped offshore about 40 years ago to expand the breakwater. Nature has since taken over and The Spit is now a public urban wilderness full of plants, birds and animals. Unmanicured and quiet except for the birds, this piece of urban wonder is an explorers delight.

    We had been meaning to make the trip since we discovered its existence last year and this past weekend the weather was perfect for a visit. We must have spent about 3 hours walking around, stopping every so often to take in the beauty of it, and sometimes the oddness of it! The &#8216;cliffs&#8217; along the shoreline were highly interesting, instead of being made up of sand or rock or soil the &#8216;cliffs&#8217; are made up of broken brick, rusted and twisted metal and concrete slabs. There were even large sections of brick wall still intact lying on the ground. Their edges worn smooth by years of water lapping over them.

    We were thoroughly delighted to happen upon the open air &#8216;art gallery&#8217;. Seemingly an homage to the rubble that gave nature the foundation on which to create this beautiful place on. Broken brick pathways, twisted metal arches, concrete block statues and glittery litter decorations all melded to create a sight to behold. Of course we couldn&#8217;t resist and immediately set about adding our own creation to the &#8216;gallery&#8217;!

    The last stop before heading out of the park amused us with the &#8216;ol fan in the tree&#8217; trick.

    Our day continued with biking along Lakeshore into the Beaches. Lunch in the Wild Earth Bakery, groceries at the store, mango/chocolate/coconut gelato in Kew Gardens, followed by a slow, tired bike ride home.
