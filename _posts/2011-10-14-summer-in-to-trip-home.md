    The drive back to Toronto &#8211; Olive caught up on her summer reading and we stopped in Jeff&#8217;s birth town &#8211; Alliston &#8211; where we ate burgers and Jeff got a four shot mug of coffee! Literally a mug of coffee that cost 8 bucks because it was deemed as two cups of coffee! Weird.
