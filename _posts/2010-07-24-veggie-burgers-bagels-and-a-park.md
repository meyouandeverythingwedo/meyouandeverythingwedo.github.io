  By day four we were ready to just sit in a cafe and while away our time reading, drinking coffee and ingesting good vegetarian food. We found just the place in the Mile End area, and they even served beer. Le Cagibi is a hodge podge cafe full of bric-a-brac, well used rustic and retro furniture, kooky spider plants, yummy food and laid back patrons.

  We devoured our veggie burgers and settled in for an afternoon of reading. Briefly putting down books to browse the nearby clothes shops. It was hard not to purchase a one of kind piece from General 54. A fabulous store selling only Canadian, many from Montreal, designers. But, there is still time to revisit!

  Two world famous bagel stores exist in the area. Predictably we couldn&#8217;t resist a pit stop at Farimount Bagel for garlic, blueberry, cumin and multi-seed bagels. We ate them later topped with hummus and they were so delicious. The entry to the bakery was stacked high with thousands of bagels. The baking area is behind the counter so we could see the humongous slab of dough being pulled apart and rolled into bagels. The smell alone inside the small space would convert even the most diehard non-gluten eating girl into indulging, despite the known digestive reaction!

  The evening ended atop a picnic blanket, books again in hand, laying in the cool greeness of the local park right at the end of our street. La Fontaine park was full of people lounging, laughing, strolling and watching the local theatre troupe.
