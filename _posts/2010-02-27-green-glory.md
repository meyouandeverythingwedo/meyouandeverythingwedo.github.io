Our new Olympic sport: Green Smoothie Guzzling. 

Current record: 3.46 seconds! 

Actually, that would make me barf. Half rhe amount you see in the pic,   
over 20 min or so, is a nice way to start the day. 

Today&#8217;s mix includes an avacado, 1 lemon, Kale, Spinach, Dandelion   
tea, and vitamin C powder and Blue Berries for Cin. 

Go Green!
