    I&#8217;m house/cat sitting for friends in town. An opportunity to base myself close to the markets, as well as make it easier to meet up with friends who don&#8217;t live down south.

    Kevin and I have a love hate relationship. She loves to hate me, but I&nbsp;can&#8217;t help but&nbsp;love her, mostly because she has the biggest attitude I&#8217;ve ever come across in a cat. So far she&#8217;s taunted me with late night meowing, early morning meowing, along with a spot of acting up late at night so I would feed her again! Which worked by the way. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m feeding her too much, but I&#8217;d rather do that and keep the peace than be walking around on eggshells in fear of the famous clawed swipes she has given me in the past.

    I&#8217;m not exaggerating about Kevin. She once pulled my birthday invitation off the fridge and chewed it up! We must&#8217;ve been enemies in a previous life! But I love her anyway and deep down she probably loves me too. Maybe.
