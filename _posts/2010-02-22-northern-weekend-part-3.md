    On the way home we drove through North Bay and along the shore of Lake Nipissing. This is not a small lake, in fact it is huge and it&#8217;s frozen solid, well not all the way to the bottom, but solid enough that trucks drive on it. Keen fishermen set up their little huts on the lake. Inside the hut a hole is drilled into the ice big enough to drop a line and wait for that elusive bite. It&#8217;s called &#8216;ice-fishing&#8217;. (<em>Information just at hand:&nbsp;it&#8217;s more likely they just drink beer and hang out, rather than actually fish!</em>)

    The clusters of huts look somewhat strange. Like a tiny town of tiny houses that look like they can only house tiny people. They must be keen to endure the freezing temperatures!

    We also stumbled upon an art exhibition. Completely random! The Ice Follies exhibition was actually on the frozen lake. Quirky ice-fishing huts, ice sculpture heads, lights on poles and a collection of dead tree branches. We couldn&#8217;t figure out what the dead trees meant, but that didn&#8217;t matter, any kind of random discovery when on holiday that adds a spark of fun is a welcome discovery.

    All in all, a winter weekend worth writing home about.
