    Back in Oz this scene would&#8217;ve appeared somewhat out of balance&#8230;snow next to the beach! But we&#8217;re in Canada and it&#8217;s perfectly normal! And it&#8217;s not really a beach, as we like to call it&#8230;faux beach.

    We took an afternoon trip to the far east side of town last weekend to Bluffers Park in Scarborough, on the shores of Lake Ontario. We weren&#8217;t expecting to see such beautiful colours all around, from the earthy coloured cliffs to the golden branches of bare trees, set against crisp white snow and the blue of the water, it was a stunning winter display.
