    With Nic, Layla and baby sister Ruby.

    We had intentions of relaxing seaside after lunch at Blue Water Cafe and a tour of Mark&#8217;s work space, a beachside gym.

    Splashing at the shoreline with Layla, whilst Nic spent quiet&nbsp;time with baby Ruby under the shade.&nbsp;Then came the wind, seems the sunshade tent isn&#8217;t a match&nbsp;for anything stronger than a sneeze! We packed up and headed home. Layla and I did manage some quality time in the water and I did manage to allow my shoulders to get burnt!
