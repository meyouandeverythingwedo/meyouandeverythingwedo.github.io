    [wpvideo LXZGadSE]<br /> This morning we returned to Notre-Dame Basilica for mass just to hear the 7000 pipe organ and choir. The sound was quite divine, with the end piece played by the organist dramatic and skin tingling.

    We finally managed a visit to one of the most popular vegan restaurants in town, Aux Vivres. Fresh juice, a kombucha drink, one smoked Montreal sandwich and a Dragon bowl later we were stuffed. Happily so. Sadly no room left for dessert. Highly recommend a stop by this relaxed, funky, delicious, animal friendly eatery whenever you&#8217;re in Montreal next.

    The &#8216;Tam Tam Jam&#8217; was heating up nearby in Mont Royal Park. A gathering of anyone and everyone playing ??hand drums (tam tams), with other instruments mixed in. The jam has been happening for around 20 years. It&#8217;s loud, it&#8217;s full of energy, it&#8217;s rhythmic, it&#8217;s intoxicating! You can participate anyway you like, by dancing, by tapping on the garbage can, by bringing your own drums or just by bouncing your shoulders while you watch. It&#8217;s great that such a participatory event open to anyone has lasted so long and draws so many people to enjoy it&#8217;s sounds. Loved the tam tam jam!

    We laid close by to the jam on our picnic blanket. Later joined by a friend living in Montreal. It&#8217;s always nice to know a local to gain more insight into a city and of course, it was nice to see Adam again.

    So now it&#8217;s the evening before we head back to Toronto. Speedily writing our postcards to make sure they get sent from Montreal and not TO!
