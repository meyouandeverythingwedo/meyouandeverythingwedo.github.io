We gathered for meditation in St. James Park from 9.30 this morning.   
Sleepy occupiers were awaking from their tents, city dwellers were   
starting their Saturday out on the streets, park birds were singing   
and cars were rolling by &#8211; a backdrop of sound to our silent sitting. 

Strangers felt compelled to join us. 

Then we marched, along King and up Bay Street, towards City Hall,   
stopping in Nathan Phillips Square to listen to the speakers share   
their stories about why they support the movement. 

Both excited and inspired today!
