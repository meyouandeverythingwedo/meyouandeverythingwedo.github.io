    Words carefully scribed onto handmade paper and a thank you card posted all the way to me from a dear friend in Australia. She often includes a sweet gift, a wonderful reminder of her kindness. My treasure this time, a sweet beaded bracelet brought back from her recent holidays.

    I love that we manage to keep up our hand written communication, this dear friend and I. Opening the post box and discovering a package is most delightful. The thought of someone choosing special paper, picking up a pen, sitting down and taking the time to prepare their thoughts, then transferring them into a story destined to travel across the ocean is most heart warming.

    This dear friend and I &#8211; I hope our handwriting days continue throughout our lifetimes.
