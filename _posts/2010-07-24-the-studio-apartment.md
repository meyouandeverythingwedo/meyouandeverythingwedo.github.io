Studio Living B&B has lived up to our expectations. A quiet sanctuary close to public transport, lively streets, walking distance to downtown, clean and with an attentive, but not too much so, host.&nbsp;Located in the Village area, or Gay Village as sometimes referred to, the lively street a couple blocks down is full of restaurants and cafes.

  Equipped with a mini kitchen, minus stove, we&#8217;re able to make our own food for picnics saving us money.&nbsp;Pretty purple petunias hang outside our windows and a lovely green back garden awaits us every morning. &nbsp;But the best part is, every day when we return from a days touring it&#8217;s like the cleaning fairy has visited and the whole studio is tidied, cleaned and stocked up. No dishes duty for a whole week!
