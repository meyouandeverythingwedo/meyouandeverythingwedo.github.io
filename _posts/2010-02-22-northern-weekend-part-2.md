    No winter weekend getaway would be complete without a little partaking in some kind of snowy outdoor sport. Snowshoeing, I think you can call it a sport, although it is unclear. Way back in the day a snowshoe looked like an oversized tennis racket, strapped to the bottom of your shoes to allow you to walk on deep soft snow without falling through. These days the &#8216;shoe&#8217; is more like a metal frame with a row of metal teeth/spike things that dig into the hard snow making it less likely to slip up or down a slope. The deeper the snow, the bigger the &#8216;shoe&#8217;, same goes for the size of the person, more weight, bigger &#8216;shoe&#8217;.

    We were out snowshoeing for two and half hours. Lucky we had the snacks and hot tea packed! By the time we stopped for the snack break my cheeks felt like they were frozen, what&#8217;s a girl to do? Wrap her scarf in such a way to warm cheeks while still allowing a cup of hot tea to reach the mouth. Ingenious!

    Whilst it was cold, whilst our cheeks did go a brilliant red colour, whilst our nostril hairs did freeze, it was so invigorating. Being out in the crisp, clean, white snow. Apart from the occasional chatter from a cross country skier gliding by or the hum of a skidoo, it was quiet. &nbsp;The kind of quiet that suggests everything is at peace.

    Along the trails were all sorts of surprises: the ice falls, trees shedding their papery bark, animal tracks, fungus surviving the freezing temperatures and right at the end, a tree stump with a pointed tip suggesting that a hard working beaver had expended a lot of energy to &#8216;chew&#8217; his way into a logging career.

    Especially fortunate for us, the hotel had a hot tub and a sauna! You can just picture the rush as we returned to our room, grab our bathers, get the towels and beeline for the warmest room in the hotel. Sure did soothe our aching muscles.
