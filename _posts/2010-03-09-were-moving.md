    &#8230;onto greener pastures, roomier quarters, outside spaces. Soon we&#8217;ll leave this little one bedroom shack. The moving date has been set for March 27, the troops have been rounded up to help out and the van rented to carry our belongings across the way.

    We&#8217;re not going far, just a couple subway stops east. The new place has two bedrooms, perfect for visitors&#8230;hint, hint <img src="http://meyouandeverythingwedo.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />

    There&#8217;s a balcony out the front, just waiting for our herbs and leafy greens and a kitchen with room to move, no more bumping into each other whilst preparing dinner.
