This was a very cool find. Walking a long the canal, seeing grain silos I started??telling Cindy about a project that had taken some abandoned silos and turned them into a musical instrument. Basically the silos have a number of microphones and speakers placed in them so that audio can be piped in and out via the telephone and internet. In a few more steps we stumbled upon the Silophone.??

  I first heard people play the Silophone at an audio art event, Diagram 11h: Silophone, in Winnipeg, 2000. Live audio performances were sent to the Silophone over the inernet and the results were sent back, after a significant delay. Playing the Silophone live, in person, is something else. There is a single microphone embeded in the concrete structure and three speakers. The results of singing into the microphone are immediate as the signals simply travel over wire directly to the speakers in the silo, no digial conversion, no internet. It&#8217;s entrancing. I could probably spend an afternoon noodling away&#8230;

  You can try it yourself via the project website: <a href="http://www.silophone.net">http://www.silophone.net</a>. From the site you can upload pre-recorded sounds and have them played into the silos.
