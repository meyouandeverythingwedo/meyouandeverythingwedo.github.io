Well, we&#8217;ve been in Adelaide for, what, just over five months now? Wow, kinda crazy really. Time really flies.

And, well, this blog and updates since leaving Canada were promised many moons ago but for technical reasons, much too uninteresting to relay, its basically here now.

There&#8217;s been some pretty nifty stuff going on over the last 5 months but maybe a quick taking stock of whats on the go now is a good place to start.

Probably the most exciting thing going on right now is that Cindy is going into business selling her handcraft! As you can see below, &#8216;Wonder What You Were&#8217; is well underway. Expect updates, announcements, and the opening of an online store in the near future.

My big thing right now is fermenting things.  Today was a good day for fermentation. We went to check out a Paleo cafe and the woman running the place had her Kombucha on display. You can&#8217;t legally sell the Kombucha scoby (mother) so she just gives it away. Score!
