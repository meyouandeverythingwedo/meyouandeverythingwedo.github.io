      There probably should be more pomp, a little bit more ceremony perhaps, but it is what it is&#8230;the first post is all about a cheezy black gold discovery.

      When a girl can&#8217;t find her Vegemite and can&#8217;t satisfy her pangs for that thick luxurious black gold, things can get a bit tense. Well, things are about to change. A random visit to the bread shop near work today uncovered what once was a well known treat at home in Oz&#8230;a Cheezy Vegemite Scroll. Yes, you heard it, way across the ocean, this little bready, cheezy, Vegemitey morsel has found its way (actually, I hope it was baked here and not actually shipped across the ocean!).

      Some of you will know of Baker&#8217;s Delight, here in Toronto, it&#8217;s Cob&#8217;s Bread. Same franchise, different name. And they have Cheezy Vegemite Scrolls!!! Albeit a little scant on the Vegemite side, but hey, a girls gotta take what she can get.

      And get this, after my exclaims of how excited I was and that the unfortunate situation is that I can&#8217;t find Vegemite anywhere in Toronto, the lady behind the counter offers up &#8220;you know there&#8217;s a butcher at Yonge and Eglington that sells it&#8221;. What, are you for real?! I predict a phone call to said butcher bright and early tomorrow.

      As for our blog. Perhaps it shoulda started with a post from both Jeff and I, but the cheezy excitement was just too much to hang on to, and he&#8217;s not home from work yet. Blogging, hopefully, will turn out to be a more regular, informative way of keeping in touch with our near (and not so near) and dear ones. Feel free to visit anytime, leave a comment or send packages full of Vegemite.
